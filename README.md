# Design Patterns

A project aimed to study the concepts and use of Design Patterns, all implemented on Java. All quotations below come from [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

> Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Creation Patterns

### These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [x] [Factory Method](CreationPatterns/FactoryMethod/src/)
- [x] [Abstract Factory](CreationPatterns/AbstractFactory/src/)
- [x] [Builder](CreationPatterns/Builder/src/)
- [x] [Prototype](CreationPatterns/Prototype/src/)
- [x] [Singleton](CreationPatterns/Singleton/src/)

## Structural Patterns

### These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator
- [ ] Facade
- [ ] Flyweight
- [ ] Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

### These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [ ] Chain of Responsibility
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Memento
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] State
- [ ] Strategy
- [ ] Template Method
- [ ] Visitor
